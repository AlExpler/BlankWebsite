                            Hey everyone! If you're there, then thank you for actually caring about what's happening.<br>
                            Don't worry, I'm okay. I'll explain everything everything to you in a moment. But before that, let me tell you about something...

                            The world of endless possibilities...

                            No Man's Sky is a great game. It's a playground of your imagination, where only your creativity is your limit. You can do whatever you want: from world exploration to bounty hunting.
                                Sometimes, while playing the game, it just might hit you with that one feeling of warping into a new system, seeing a massive ringed planet, and wondering what secrets it holds.
                                Or sometimes you just let yourslef drift away into the void and rethink on meaningful moments of your life...
                                Or that feeling of when whatever you do or create gets an actual appreciation from players or even NPCs... Yeah...<br><br>
                                It's wonderful that whenever you do something, it doesn't leave unnoticed. It's either you make Atlas proud of your another creation or discovery, or you restore the long-lost home of Autophages, or save other kindred souls from their horrible fate.
                                No matter what you do, it will be appreciated by someone. It just... makes you feel like you're doing something significant, something so meaningful. It makes you feel <i>happy...</i><br>

                                I know this is going to sound like I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, and I know the cause of all of this is purely my fault, but...<br>
                                Most of the connections I make in VRChat just... come and go. You meet people, you talk a little or you cuddle for a while and then they're just... Gone.
                                Even in a span of a few hours, people already forget about you and move on. I want to keep talking to a person, I genuenly want to know that person better, but not everyone is like that.<br><br>
                                I understand why people cuddle with strangers. I love cuddles myself, I love that attention I get.
                                I understand why people might forget the person. They have friends after all, and get easily distracted on them from the person they just met.
                                But because of that, all this effort that you put to try to start a friendship with a person, even if it was small, fells, just, like it was put for nothing. You don't fell that same kind of
                                warmth on your heart. Quite the opposite, it might even hurt sometimes.<br><br>
                                I'm glad I managed to make so many friends in the time while I was active on VRChat, but I need some time to take a break from all the fails and to work on myself so I wouldn't get into the same issue again.<br><br>
                                <l>- Thank you all, I love you.</l>
